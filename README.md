# Everything_Python
 Python bindings for the Everything Service API
 
 Everything is a windows-based program that lets a user index and very quickly search on the order of millions of files.
 There is an SDK for the program, which is written in C++.
 
 Everything-Python is exactly what the name suggests: Python bindings for the C++ functionality so that python scripters can leverage this extremely powerful service.
 
 The bindings are generated with pybind11, a super easy to use library that lets user wrap complex C++ code and expose it in a python .pyd module.
